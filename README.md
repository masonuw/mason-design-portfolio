# mason-design-portfolio

## Description

I built this project to function as my own personal portfolio, as I do not have one yet and as a future web developer and software engineer this is something that is very important to my success. It displays some of my biggest projects yet with my biggest project at the top of the page. Throughout this project, I learned how to stylize a page to have it best fit my needs visually and structurally.

## Installation

No installation required. Simply navigate to the website to view it.

## Usage

The instructions are very minimal. Simply scroll the page either using a mouse or through use of the navigation buttons in the top right, and to view a project click on the corresponding image. To contact me personally, use the GitHub link on the bottom of the page or the email listed.
